<p>Interactive Electrode Potentials</p>
<p></p>This repository contains a web-based interactive platform designed to visualize and explore electrode potentials of various elements and ions. The goal of this project is to provide an engaging and informative way to understand the electrochemical series and the reduction potential of different substances.</p>
Features
Interactive Electrode Potentials Table: View and explore the standard electrode potentials of various elements, from fluorine to lithium.
 Real-time Visualization: Visualize redox reactions and understand how different elements interact at the electrode surface.
Searchable Database: Easily search for specific elements and their corresponding electrode potentials.
Detailed Information: For each element, find its half-reaction, standard electrode potential, and common uses in electrochemistry.
Project Overview
